# contributing 

As a general rule, we encourage everyone to make a pull request on whatever you see fit, I cannot promise that it will be approved but, I will do my best to help you be successful. If the feature you want does not exist please make an issue! I want this project to be the best it can be. If I say no, I will try to explain why. But if you're just getting started you can join the discord https://discord.gg/MscBpuBr

# project charter

## mission 

To deliver a viable innovative library for creating the next generation of AIs, this project does not mind being a ginny pig for unconventional ideas. Our mission is to bring new technology to the hands of developers and to do so will grace and elegance with a minimal barrier to entry. 

### project values 
- respecting user privacy
- maintaining an open and welcoming community
- encouraging dialog and teamwork
- limiting technical debt where ever possible 

### project requirements 
- must have the ability to turn on and off all none essential features. 
- all functions, types, methods, and tests must be documented no exceptions 
- user must be able to export/import the base model as data. 

#### Current goal for 2023 

The goal at the moment is to get liberty to a usable state, we will then focus on standardizing the format in which you interact with the model with a small API. As of 2023 performance is not a concern to me, if that's what you want, go to a more mature library. 

My goal at the moment is to understand neural networks at a deep level and program them in a way I find intuitive and reusable when the project is more developed and has users I will focus on performance. I am also a college student studying Computer Sciences who want to participate in active research in deep learning this project will be subject to some interesting experiments all of which should be optional features unless impractical.
