#  Gorebrum

 Gorebrum is an open-source AI library written in the go programming language, which focuses on a highly concurrent and flexible approach and exportable AI models


# project status: 
this is a toy project not intended for actual use

### Key planned features 
- concurrency: not functional 
- GPU compute: not functional
- exportable models:  functional in XML

#### Current goal for 2023 

The goal at the moment is to get Liberty to a usable state. We will then focus on standardizing the format in which you interact with the model with a small API. As of 2023, performance is not a concern to me. If that's what you want, go to a more mature library. 

My goal at the moment is to understand neural networks at a deep level and program them in a way I find intuitive and reusable. When the project is more developed and has users, I will focus on performance. I am also a college student studying Computer Science and want to participate in active research in deep learning. This project will be subject to some interesting experiments, all of which should be optional features unless impractical.
